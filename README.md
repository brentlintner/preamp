Make Media Player, add view for "New Albums" and "Reccomended Artists" that opens up in Spotify App

Ideally if arch supports it, have add to music that is tiny db of artists etc that gets merged into main library (do I really want this? let Plex stew, but it's nice to have music I don't really want to necessarily buy :-/)
