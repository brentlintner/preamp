## Feature 1

* On Artist Page have dupe albums view that shows "Missing Albums" that opens album in Spotify App

## Feature 2

* On Artist Page have dupe albums view that shows "Related Artists" that opens in Spotify App

## Feature 3

* Possibly have a similar Add To Library feature for Spotify content (big feature, and if I really want to dupe this UX or go back to DAP UX while Plex gets its shit together)
